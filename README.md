## ðŸŽ¯ Description

This project is part of my **CODTECH Internship Program** under **Task-2: Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning**.

The objective of this internship task was to:

* Build a **machine learning model** to predict outcomes based on a dataset.
* Perform **data preprocessing** and **feature engineering** to prepare input data.
* Apply **feature selection** techniques to identify the most relevant variables.
* Train and evaluate models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
* Assess model performance using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **ROC-AUC** metrics.

By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

* **Machine Learning workflows** (data splitting, training, validation, and testing).
* **Feature Engineering** (creating new features from existing data).
* **Model Evaluation Techniques** (comparing models using performance metrics).
* **Predictive Analytics** (using data to forecast user behavior and preferences).

This internship experience strengthened my understanding of **supervised learning**, **classification models**, and **practical applications of predictive analytics** in real-world recommendation systems.
